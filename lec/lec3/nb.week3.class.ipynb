Sometimes there are multiple codes for things like, *not asked*, *did not know*, and *declined to answer*. And there are almost always errors.

Here, our data set is assumed to be the entire **population** of red wines, so the formula, and manual implementation of standard deviation is correct.  What Python has computed is the \"sample\" standard deviation, $$s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_i(x_i-\\bar{x})^2.$$  The population and sample standard deviation is related by the formula $$ s^2 = \\frac{n-1}{n}\\sigma^2.$$  As $n\\to\\infty$, the population and sample standard deviation approach each other."
