    "## Shell Commands \n",
    "\n",
    "*from Python Data Science Handbook, by Jake VanderPlas* \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks give you a syntax for executing shell commands directly from within the notebook. The magic happens with the exclamation point: anything appearing after `!` on a line will be executed not by the Python kernel, but by the system command-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following assumes you're on a Unix-like system, such as Linux or Mac OSX or Colab Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Review: Introduction to the Shell \n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is a way to interact textually with your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Someone unfamiliar with the shell might ask why you would bother with this, when many results can be accomplished by simply clicking on icons and menus. A shell user might reply with another question: why hunt icons and click menus when you can accomplish things much more easily by typing? While it might sound like a typical tech preference impasse, when moving beyond basic tasks it quickly becomes clear that the shell offers much more control of advanced tasks, though admittedly the learning curve can intimidate the average computer user.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here is a sample of a Linux/OSX shell session where a user explores, creates, and modifies directories and files on their system (`osx:~ $` is the prompt, and everything after the $ sign is the typed command; text that is preceded by a `#` is meant just as description, rather than something you would actually type in):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "osx:~ $ echo \"hello world\"             # echo is like Python's print function\n",
    "hello world\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:~ $ pwd                            # pwd = print working directory\n",
    "/Users/lebrown                             # this is the \"path\" that we're sitting in\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:~ $ ls                             # ls = list working directory contents\n",
    "Applications       Movies  \n",
    "Desktop            Music\n",
    "Documents          Pictures\n",
    "Downloads          Public\n",
    "Library            Work\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:~ $ cd Work/                       # cd = change directory\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:Work $ pwd\n",
    "/Users/lebrown/Work\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:Work $ ls\n",
    "Courses            Research         Projects\n",
    "temp.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:Work $ mkdir myproject             # mkdir = make new directory\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:Work $ cd myproject/\n",
    "\n",
    "osx:myproject $ mv ../temp.txt ./      # mv = move file. Here we're moving the\n",
    "                                       # file temp.txt from one directory\n",
    "                                       # up (../) to the current directory (./)\n",
    "osx:myproject $ ls\n",
    "temp.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a compact way to do familiar operations (navigating a directory structure, creating a directory, moving a file, etc.) by typing commands rather than clicking icons and menus.\n",
    "Note that with just a few commands (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir``, and ``cp``) you can do many of the most common file operations.\n",
    "It's when you go beyond these basics that the shell approach becomes really powerful.\n"

      "But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?\n",
      "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\n",
      "Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\n",
      "Who is already sick and pale with grief,\n",
      "That thou her maid art far more fair than she:\n",
      "Be not her maid, since she is envious;\n",

      "That I might touch that cheek!\n",
      "Ay me!\n",
      "She speaks:\n",
      "O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\n",
      "As glorious to this night, being o'er my head\n",
      "As is a winged messenger of heaven\n",
      "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes\n",

      "And sails upon the bosom of the air.\n",
      "O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\n",
      "Deny thy father and refuse thy name;\n",
      "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\n",

      "Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part\n",
      "Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!\n",
      "What's in a name? that which we call a rose\n",
      "By any other name would smell as sweet;\n",
      "So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\n",
      "Retain that dear perfection which he owes\n",
      "Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\n",
      "And for that name which is no part of thee\n",
      "Take all myself.\n",
      "                  I take thee at thy word:\n",
      "Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;\n",
      "Henceforth I never will be Romeo.\n",
      "What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night\n",
      "So stumblest on my counsel?\n",
      "By a name\n",
      "I know not how to tell thee who I am:\n",
      "My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\n",
      "Because it is an enemy to thee;\n",
      "Had I it written, I would tear the word.\n",
      "My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words\n",
      "Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:\n",
      "Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?\n",
      "Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\n",
      "How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\n",
      "The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\n",
      "And the place death, considering who thou art,\n",
      "If any of my kinsmen find thee here.\n",
      "With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;\n",
      "For stony limits cannot hold love out,\n",
      "And what love can do that dares love attempt;\n",
      "Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\n",
      "If they do see thee, they will murder thee.\n",
      "Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\n",
      "Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,\n",
      "And I am proof against their enmity.\n",
      "I would not for the world they saw thee here.\n",
      "I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\n",
      "And but thou love me, let them find me here:\n",
      "My life were better ended by their hate,\n",
      "Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\n",
      "By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\n",
      "By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;\n",
      "He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.\n",
      "I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\n",
      "As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\n",
      "I would adventure for such merchandise.\n",
      "Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,\n",
      "Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\n",
      "For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night\n",
      "Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\n",
      "What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!\n",
      "Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'\n",
      "And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,\n",
      "Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries\n",
      "Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\n",
      "If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:\n",
      "Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,\n",
      "I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,\n",
      "So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\n",
      "In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\n",
      "And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:\n",
      "But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\n",
      "Than those that have more cunning to be strange.\n",
      "I should have been more strange, I must confess,\n",
      "But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\n",
      "My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,\n",
      "And not impute this yielding to light love,\n",
      "Which the dark night hath so discovered.\n",
      "Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear\n",
      "That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--\n",
      "O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\n",
      "That monthly changes in her circled orb,\n",
      "Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n",
      "What shall I swear by?\n",
      "Do not swear at all;\n",
      "Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\n",
      "Which is the god of my idolatry,\n",
      "And I'll believe thee.\n",
      "If my heart's dear love--\n",
      "Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,\n",
      "I have no joy of this contract to-night:\n",
      "It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\n",
      "Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be\n",
      "Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\n",
      "This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\n",
      "May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\n",
      "Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest\n",
      "Come to thy heart as that within my breast!\n",
      "O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n",
      "What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\n",
      "The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\n",
      "I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:\n",
      "And yet I would it were to give again.\n",
      "Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?\n",
      "But to be frank, and give it thee again.\n",
      "And yet I wish but for the thing I have:\n",
      "My bounty is as boundless as the sea,\n",
      "My love as deep; the more I give to thee,\n",
      "The more I have, for both are infinite.\n",
      "I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!\n",
      "Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\n",
      "Stay but a little, I will come again.\n",
      "O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.\n",
      "Being in night, all this is but a dream,\n",
      "Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.\n",
      "Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\n",
      "If that thy bent of love be honourable,\n",
      "Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\n",
      "By one that I'll procure to come to thee,\n",
      "Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\n",
      "And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\n",
      "And follow thee my lord throughout the world.\n",
      "  Madam!\n",
      "I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,\n",
      "I do beseech thee--\n",
      "  Madam!\n",
      "By and by, I come:--\n",
      "To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:\n",
      "To-morrow will I send.\n",
      "So thrive my soul--\n",
      "A thousand times good night!\n",
      "A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\n",
      "Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from\n",
      "their books,\n",
      "But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.\n",
      "Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,\n",
      "To lure this tassel-gentle back again!\n",
      "Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;\n",
      "Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\n",
      "And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,\n",
      "With repetition of my Romeo's name.\n",
      "It is my soul that calls upon my name:\n",
      "How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\n",
      "Like softest music to attending ears!\n",
      "Romeo!\n",
      "     My dear?\n",
      "                  At what o'clock to-morrow\n",
      "Shall I send to thee?\n",
      "At the hour of nine.\n",
      "I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.\n",
      "I have forgot why I did call thee back.\n",
      "Let me stand here till thou remember it.\n",
      "I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\n",
      "Remembering how I love thy company.\n",
      "And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\n",
      "Forgetting any other home but this.\n",
      "'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:\n",
      "And yet no further than a wanton's bird;\n",
      "Who lets it hop a little from her hand,\n",
      "Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\n",
      "And with a silk thread plucks it back again,\n",
      "So loving-jealous of his liberty.\n",
      "I would I were thy bird.\n",
      "Sweet, so would I:\n",
      "Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\n",
      "Good night, good night! parting is such\n",
      "sweet sorrow,\n",
      "That I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n",
      "Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\n",
      "Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\n",
      "Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\n",
      "His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.\n",
      "The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,\n",
      "Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,\n",
      "And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\n",
      "From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:\n",
      "Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\n",
      "The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,\n",

      "With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\n",
      "The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;\n",
      "What is her burying grave that is her womb,\n",
      "And from her womb children of divers kind\n",
      "We sucking on her natural bosom find,\n",
      "Many for many virtues excellent,\n",
      "None but for some and yet all different.\n",
      "O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\n",
      "In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:\n",
      "For nought so vile that on the earth doth live\n",
      "But to the earth some special good doth give,\n",
      "Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use\n",
      "Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:\n",
      "Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;\n",
      "And vice sometimes by action dignified.\n",
      "Within the infant rind of this small flower\n",
      "Poison hath residence and medicine power:\n",
      "For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\n",
      "Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\n",
      "Two such opposed kings encamp them still\n",
      "In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;\n",
      "And where the worser is predominant,\n",
      "Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n",
      "Good morrow, father.\n",
      "Benedicite!\n",
      "What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\n",
      "Young son, it argues a distemper'd head\n",
      "So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:\n",
      "Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,\n",
      "And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;\n",
      "But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain\n",
      "Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:\n",
      "Therefore thy earliness doth me assure\n",
      "Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;\n",
      "Or if not so, then here I hit it right,\n",
      "Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.\n",
      "That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\n",
      "God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?\n",
      "With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;\n",
      "I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.\n",
      "That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?\n",
      "I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.\n",
      "I have been feasting with mine enemy,\n",
      "Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,\n",
      "That's by me wounded: both our remedies\n",
      "Within thy help and holy physic lies:\n",
      "I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\n",
      "My intercession likewise steads my foe.\n",
      "Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\n",
      "Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n",
      "Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set\n",
      "On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:\n",
      "As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\n",
      "And all combined, save what thou must combine\n",
      "By holy marriage: when and where and how\n",
      "We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,\n",
      "I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\n",
      "That thou consent to marry us to-day.\n",
      "Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!\n",
      "Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,\n",
      "So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies\n",
      "Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\n",
      "Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine\n",
      "Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\n",
      "How much salt water thrown away in waste,\n",
      "To season love, that of it doth not taste!\n",
      "The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\n",
      "Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;\n",
      "Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\n",
      "Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:\n",
      "If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,\n",
      "Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:\n",
      "And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,\n",
      "Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.\n",
      "Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n",
      "For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n",
      "And bad'st me bury love.\n",
      "Not in a grave,\n",
      "To lay one in, another out to have.\n",
      "I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now\n",
      "Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;\n",
      "The other did not so.\n",
      "O, she knew well\n",
      "Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.\n",
      "But come, young waverer, come, go with me,\n",
      "In one respect I'll thy assistant be;\n",
      "For this alliance may so happy prove,\n",
      "To turn your households' rancour to pure love.\n",
      "O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\n",
      "Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n",
      "Where the devil should this Romeo be?\n",
      "Came he not home to-night?\n",
      "Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.\n",
      "Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.\n",
      "Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.\n",
      "Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,\n",
      "Hath sent a letter to his father's house.\n",
      "A challenge, on my life.\n",
      "Romeo will answer it.\n",
      "Any man that can write may answer a letter.\n",
      "Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he\n",
      "dares, being dared.\n",
      "Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a\n",
      "white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a\n",
      "love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the\n",
      "blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to\n",
      "encounter Tybalt?\n",
      "Why, what is Tybalt?\n",
      "More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is\n",
      "the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as\n",
      "you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and\n",
      "proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and\n",
      "the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk\n",
      "button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the\n",
      "very first house, of the first and second cause:\n",
      "ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the\n",
      "hai!\n",
      "The what?\n",
      "The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting\n",
      "fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,\n",
      "a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good\n",
      "whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\n",
      "grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with\n",
      "these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these\n",
      "perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,\n",
      "that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their\n",
      "bones, their bones!\n",
      "Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.\n",
      "Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,\n",
      "how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers\n",
      "that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a\n",
      "kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to\n",
      "be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;\n",
      "Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey\n",
      "eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\n",
      "Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation\n",
      "to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\n",
      "fairly last night.\n",
      "Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\n",
      "The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\n",
      "Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in\n",
      "such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\n",
      "That's as much as to say, such a case as yours\n",
      "constrains a man to bow in the hams.\n",
      "Meaning, to court'sy.\n",
      "Thou hast most kindly hit it.\n",
      "A most courteous exposition.\n",
      "Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n",
      "Pink for flower.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Why, then is my pump well flowered.\n",
      "Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast\n",
      "worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it\n",
      "is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.\n",
      "O single-soled jest, solely singular for the\n",
      "singleness.\n",
      "Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\n",
      "Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.\n",
      "Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have\n",
      "done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of\n",
      "thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:\n",
      "was I with you there for the goose?\n",
      "Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast\n",
      "not there for the goose.\n",
      "I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n",
      "Nay, good goose, bite not.\n",
      "Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most\n",
      "sharp sauce.\n",
      "And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?\n",
      "O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an\n",
      "inch narrow to an ell broad!\n",
      "I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added\n",
      "to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\n",
      "Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?\n",
      "now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art\n",
      "thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:\n",
      "for this drivelling love is like a great natural,\n",
      "that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\n",
      "Stop there, stop there.\n",
      "Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\n",
      "Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n",
      "O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:\n",
      "for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and\n",
      "meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.\n",
      "Here's goodly gear!\n",
      "A sail, a sail!\n",
      "Two, two; a shirt and a smock.\n",
      "Peter!\n",
      "Anon!\n",
      "My fan, Peter.\n",
      "Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the\n",
      "fairer face.\n",
      "God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\n",
      "God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.\n",
      "Is it good den?\n",
      "'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the\n",
      "dial is now upon the prick of noon.\n",
      "Out upon you! what a man are you!\n",
      "One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to\n",
      "mar.\n",
      "By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'\n",
      "quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I\n",
      "may find the young Romeo?\n",
      "I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when\n",
      "you have found him than he was when you sought him:\n",
      "I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.\n",
      "You say well.\n",
      "Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;\n",
      "wisely, wisely.\n",
      "if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with\n",
      "you.\n",
      "She will indite him to some supper.\n",
      "A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!\n",
      "What hast thou found?\n",
      "No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,\n",
      "that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.\n",
      "An old hare hoar,\n",
      "And an old hare hoar,\n",
      "Is very good meat in lent\n",
      "But a hare that is hoar\n",
      "Is too much for a score,\n",
      "When it hoars ere it be spent.\n",
      "Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll\n",
      "to dinner, thither.\n",
      "I will follow you.\n",
      "Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,\n",
      "'lady, lady, lady.'\n",
      "Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy\n",
      "merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?\n",
      "A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,\n",
      "and will speak more in a minute than he will stand\n",
      "to in a month.\n",
      "An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him\n",
      "down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such\n",
      "Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.\n",
      "Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am\n",
      "none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by\n",
      "too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?\n",
      "I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon\n",
      "should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare\n",
      "draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a\n",
      "good quarrel, and the law on my side.\n",
      "Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about\n",
      "me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:\n",
      "and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you\n",
      "out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:\n",
      "but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into\n",
      "a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\n",
      "kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman\n",
      "is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double\n",
      "with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered\n",
      "to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\n",
      "Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I\n",
      "protest unto thee--\n",
      "Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:\n",
      "Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.\n",
      "What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.\n",
      "I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as\n",
      "I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\n",
      "Bid her devise\n",
      "Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;\n",
      "And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\n",
      "Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.\n",
      "No truly sir; not a penny.\n",
      "Go to; I say you shall.\n",
      "This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.\n",
      "And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:\n",
      "Within this hour my man shall be with thee\n",
      "And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;\n",
      "Which to the high top-gallant of my joy\n",
      "Must be my convoy in the secret night.\n",
      "Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:\n",
      "Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.\n",
      "Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\n",
      "What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\n",
      "Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\n",
      "Two may keep counsel, putting one away?\n",
      "I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.\n",
      "Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,\n",
      "Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there\n",
      "is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain\n",
      "lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief\n",
      "see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her\n",
      "sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer\n",
      "man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks\n",
      "as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not\n",
      "rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?\n",
      "Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.\n",
      "Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for\n",
      "the--No; I know it begins with some other\n",
      "letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of\n",
      "it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good\n",
      "to hear it.\n",
      "Commend me to thy lady.\n",
      "Ay, a thousand times.\n",
      "Peter!\n",
      "Anon!\n",
      "Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.\n",
      "The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;\n",
      "In half an hour she promised to return.\n",
      "Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.\n",
      "O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,\n",
      "Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,\n",
      "Driving back shadows over louring hills:\n",
      "Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,\n",
      "And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\n",
      "Now is the sun upon the highmost hill\n",
      "Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\n",
      "Is three long hours, yet she is not come.\n",
      "Had she affections and warm youthful blood,\n",
      "She would be as swift in motion as a ball;\n",
      "My words would bandy her to my sweet love,\n",
      "And his to me:\n",
      "But old folks, many feign as they were dead;\n",
      "Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\n",
      "O God, she comes!\n",
      "O honey nurse, what news?\n",
      "Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n",
      "Peter, stay at the gate.\n",
      "Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?\n",
      "Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\n",
      "If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\n",
      "By playing it to me with so sour a face.\n",
      "I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:\n",
      "Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!\n",
      "I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\n",

      "Do you not see that I am out of breath?\n",
      "How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\n",
      "To say to me that thou art out of breath?\n",
      "The excuse that thou dost make in this delay\n",

      "How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal\n",
      "Your high displeasure: all this uttered\n",
      "With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,\n",
      "Could not take truce with the unruly spleen\n",

      "With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,\n",
      "Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,\n",
      "And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\n",
      "Cold death aside, and with the other sends\n",

      "And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I\n",
      "Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.\n",
      "And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\n",
      "This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n",
      "He is a kinsman to the Montague;\n",
      "Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:\n",

      "Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,\n",
      "Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,\n",
      "Take him and cut him out in little stars,\n",
      "And he will make the face of heaven so fine\n",
      "That all the world will be in love with night\n",
      "And pay no worship to the garish sun.\n",
      "O, I have bought the mansion of a love,\n",
      "But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,\n",
      "Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day\n",
      "As is the night before some festival\n",

      "Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!\n",
      "What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?\n",
      "This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.\n",
      "Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'\n",
      "And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more\n",

      "For such a wish! he was not born to shame:\n",
      "Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;\n",
      "For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\n",
      "Sole monarch of the universal earth.\n",
      "O, what a beast was I to chide at him!\n",
      "Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?\n",
      "Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\n",
      "Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,\n",
      "When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\n",
      "But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\n",
      "That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:\n",

      "Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\n",
      "That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;\n",
      "But, O, it presses to my memory,\n",
      "Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:\n",
      "'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'\n",
      "That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\n",
      "Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\n",
      "Was woe enough, if it had ended there:\n",
      "Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship\n",
      "And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\n",

      "Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,\n",
      "Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,\n",

      "Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,\n",
      "A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\n",

      "Why should you fall into so deep an O?\n",
      "Nurse!\n",
      "Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\n",
      "Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?\n",
      "Doth she not think me an old murderer,\n",
      "Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\n",
      "With blood removed but little from her own?\n",
      "Where is she? and how doth she? and what says\n",
      "My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\n",
      "O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\n",
      "And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,\n",
      "And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\n",
      "And then down falls again.\n",
      "As if that name,\n",
      "Shot from the deadly level of a gun,\n",
      "Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand\n",
      "Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\n",
      "In what vile part of this anatomy\n",
      "Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack\n",
      "The hateful mansion.\n",
      "Hold thy desperate hand:\n",
      "Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:\n",
      "Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote\n",
      "The unreasonable fury of a beast:\n",
      "Unseemly woman in a seeming man!\n",
      "Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\n",

      "Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?\n",
      "And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,\n",
      "By doing damned hate upon thyself?\n",
      "Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\n",
      "Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet\n",
      "In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\n",
      "Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;\n",
      "Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\n",
      "And usest none in that true use indeed\n",
      "Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:\n",
      "Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,\n",
      "Digressing from the valour of a man;\n",
      "Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\n",
      "Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\n",
      "Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\n",
      "Misshapen in the conduct of them both,\n",
      "Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,\n",
      "Is set afire by thine own ignorance,\n",
      "And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.\n",
      "What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,\n",
      "For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;\n",
      "There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,\n",
      "But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:\n",
      "The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend\n",
      "And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:\n",
      "A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;\n",
      "Happiness courts thee in her best array;\n",
      "But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,\n",
      "Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:\n",
      "Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\n",
      "Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\n",
      "Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:\n",
      "But look thou stay not till the watch be set,\n",
      "For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;\n",
      "Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time\n",
      "To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\n",
      "Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back\n",
      "With twenty hundred thousand times more joy\n",
      "Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.\n",
      "Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;\n",
      "And bid her hasten all the house to bed,\n",
      "Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:\n",
      "Romeo is coming.\n",
      "O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\n",
      "To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!\n",
      "My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\n",
      "Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\n",
      "Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:\n",
      "Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.\n",
      "How well my comfort is revived by this!\n",
      "Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\n",
      "Either be gone before the watch be set,\n",
      "Or by the break of day disguised from hence:\n",
      "Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,\n",
      "And he shall signify from time to time\n",
      "Every good hap to you that chances here:\n",
      "Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.\n",
      "But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\n",
      "It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.\n",
      "Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,\n",
      "That we have had no time to move our daughter:\n",
      "Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\n",
      "And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.\n",
      "'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:\n",
      "I promise you, but for your company,\n",
      "I would have been a-bed an hour ago.\n",
      "These times of woe afford no time to woo.\n",
      "Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.\n",
      "I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;\n",
      "To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.\n",
      "Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender\n",
      "Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled\n",
      "In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.\n",
      "Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;\n",
      "Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;\n",
      "And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--\n",
      "But, soft! what day is this?\n",
      "Monday, my lord,\n",
      "Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,\n",
      "O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,\n",
      "She shall be married to this noble earl.\n",
      "Will you be ready? do you like this haste?\n",
      "We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;\n",
      "For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\n",
      "It may be thought we held him carelessly,\n",
      "Being our kinsman, if we revel much:\n",
      "Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,\n",
      "And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\n",
      "My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.\n",
      "Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.\n",
      "Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,\n",
      "Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.\n",
      "Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!\n",
      "Afore me! it is so very very late,\n",
      "That we may call it early by and by.\n",
      "Good night.\n",
      "Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:\n",
      "It was the nightingale, and not the lark,\n",
      "That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;\n",
      "Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:\n",
      "Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\n",
      "It was the lark, the herald of the morn,\n",
      "No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks\n",
      "Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:\n",
      "Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\n",
      "Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\n",
      "I must be gone and live, or stay and die.\n",
      "Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:\n",
      "It is some meteor that the sun exhales,\n",
      "To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,\n",
      "And light thee on thy way to Mantua:\n",
      "Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.\n",
      "Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;\n",
      "I am content, so thou wilt have it so.\n",
      "I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,\n",
      "'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;\n",
      "Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat\n",
      "The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:\n",
      "I have more care to stay than will to go:\n",
      "Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.\n",
      "How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.\n",
      "It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!\n",
      "It is the lark that sings so out of tune,\n",
      "Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\n",
      "Some say the lark makes sweet division;\n",
      "This doth not so, for she divideth us:\n",
      "Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,\n",
      "O, now I would they had changed voices too!\n",
      "Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\n",
      "Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,\n",
      "O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.\n",
      "More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!\n",
      "Madam!\n",
      "Nurse?\n",
      "Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:\n",
      "The day is broke; be wary, look about.\n",
      "Then, window, let day in, and let life out.\n",
      "Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.\n",
      "Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!\n",
      "I must hear from thee every day in the hour,\n",
      "For in a minute there are many days:\n",
      "O, by this count I shall be much in years\n",
      "Ere I again behold my Romeo!\n",
      "Farewell!\n",
      "I will omit no opportunity\n",
      "That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.\n",
      "O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?\n",
      "I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve\n",
      "For sweet discourses in our time to come.\n",
      "O God, I have an ill-divining soul!\n",
      "Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,\n",
      "As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:\n",
      "Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.\n",
      "And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:\n",
      "Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!\n",
      "O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:\n",
      "If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.\n",
      "That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;\n",
      "For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,\n",
      "But send him back.\n",
      "         Ho, daughter! are you up?\n",
      "Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?\n",
      "Is she not down so late, or up so early?\n",
      "What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?\n",
      "Why, how now, Juliet!\n",
      "Madam, I am not well.\n",
      "Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?\n",
      "What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?\n",
      "An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;\n",
      "Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;\n",
      "But much of grief shows still some want of wit.\n",
      "Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\n",
      "So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\n",
      "Which you weep for.\n",
      "Feeling so the loss,\n",
      "Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\n",
      "Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,\n",
      "As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.\n",
      "What villain madam?\n",
      "That same villain, Romeo.\n",
      "  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--\n",
      "God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;\n",
      "And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\n",
      "That is, because the traitor murderer lives.\n",
      "Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:\n",
      "Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!\n",
      "We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:\n",
      "Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\n",
      "Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,\n",
      "Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,\n",
      "That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:\n",
      "And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.\n",
      "Indeed, I never shall be satisfied\n",
      "With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--\n",
      "Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.\n",
      "Madam, if you could find out but a man\n",
      "To bear a poison, I would temper it;\n",
      "That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\n",
      "Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\n",
      "To hear him named, and cannot come to him.\n",
      "To wreak the love I bore my cousin\n",
      "Upon his body that slaughter'd him!\n",
      "Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\n",
      "But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\n",
      "And joy comes well in such a needy time:\n",
      "What are they, I beseech your ladyship?\n",
      "Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;\n",
      "One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\n",
      "Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,\n",
      "That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.\n",
      "Madam, in happy time, what day is that?\n",
      "Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,\n",

      "He shall not make me there a joyful bride.\n",
      "I wonder at this haste; that I must wed\n",
      "Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.\n",
      "I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,\n",
      "I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,\n",
      "It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\n",
      "Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!\n",

      "Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;\n",
      "Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,\n",
      "Without a sudden calm, will overset\n",
      "Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!\n",

      "Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.\n",

      "And then to have a wretched puling fool,\n",
      "A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\n",

      "I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'\n",

      "Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous\n",
      "That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,\n",
      "And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,\n",
      "To stop the inundation of her tears;\n",
      "Which, too much minded by herself alone,\n",
      "May be put from her by society:\n",
      "Now do you know the reason of this haste.\n",
      "  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.\n",
      "Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.\n",
      "Happily met, my lady and my wife!\n",
      "That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n",
      "That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\n",
      "What must be shall be.\n",
      "That's a certain text.\n",
      "Come you to make confession to this father?\n",
      "To answer that, I should confess to you.\n",
      "Do not deny to him that you love me.\n",
      "I will confess to you that I love him.\n",
      "So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\n",
      "If I do so, it will be of more price,\n",
      "Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.\n",
      "Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.\n",
      "The tears have got small victory by that;\n",
      "For it was bad enough before their spite.\n",
      "Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.\n",
      "That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\n",
      "And what I spake, I spake it to my face.\n",
      "Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.\n",
      "It may be so, for it is not mine own.\n",
      "Are you at leisure, holy father, now;\n",
      "Or shall I come to you at evening mass?\n",
      "My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\n",
      "My lord, we must entreat the time alone.\n",
      "God shield I should disturb devotion!\n",
      "Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:\n",
      "Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.\n",
      "O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\n",
      "Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!\n",
      "Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\n",
      "It strains me past the compass of my wits:\n",
      "I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\n",
      "On Thursday next be married to this county.\n",
      "Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\n",
      "Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:\n",
      "If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,\n",
      "Do thou but call my resolution wise,\n",
      "And with this knife I'll help it presently.\n",
      "God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\n",
      "And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,\n",
      "Shall be the label to another deed,\n",
      "Or my true heart with treacherous revolt\n",
      "Turn to another, this shall slay them both:\n",
      "Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,\n",
      "Give me some present counsel, or, behold,\n",
      "'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\n",
      "Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that\n",
      "Which the commission of thy years and art\n",
      "Could to no issue of true honour bring.\n",
      "Be not so long to speak; I long to die,\n",
      "If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\n",
      "Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,\n",
      "Which craves as desperate an execution.\n",
      "As that is desperate which we would prevent.\n",
      "If, rather than to marry County Paris,\n",
      "Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\n",
      "Then is it likely thou wilt undertake\n",
      "A thing like death to chide away this shame,\n",
      "That copest with death himself to scape from it:\n",
      "And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.\n",
      "O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\n",
      "From off the battlements of yonder tower;\n",
      "Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk\n",
      "Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;\n",
      "Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,\n",
      "O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\n",
      "With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\n",
      "Or bid me go into a new-made grave\n",
      "And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;\n",
      "Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;\n",
      "And I will do it without fear or doubt,\n",
      "To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\n",
      "Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent\n",
      "To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:\n",
      "To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\n",
      "Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:\n",
      "Take thou this vial, being then in bed,\n",
      "And this distilled liquor drink thou off;\n",
      "When presently through all thy veins shall run\n",
      "A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse\n",
      "Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:\n",
      "No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\n",
      "The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\n",
      "To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,\n",
      "Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;\n",
      "Each part, deprived of supple government,\n",
      "Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:\n",
      "And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death\n",
      "Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,\n",
      "And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\n",
      "Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\n",
      "To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:\n",
      "Then, as the manner of our country is,\n",
      "In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier\n",
      "Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\n",
      "Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\n",
      "In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\n",
      "Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,\n",
      "And hither shall he come: and he and I\n",
      "Will watch thy waking, and that very night\n",
      "Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\n",
      "And this shall free thee from this present shame;\n",
      "If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,\n",
      "Abate thy valour in the acting it.\n",
      "Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\n",
      "Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous\n",
      "In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed\n",
      "To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\n",
      "Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\n",
      "Farewell, dear father!\n",
      "So many guests invite as here are writ.\n",
      "Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.\n",
      "You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they\n",
      "can lick their fingers.\n",
      "How canst thou try them so?\n",
      "Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his\n",
      "own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his\n",
      "fingers goes not with me.\n",
      "Go, be gone.\n",
      "We shall be much unfurnished for this time.\n",
      "What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?\n",
      "Ay, forsooth.\n",
      "Well, he may chance to do some good on her:\n",
      "A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.\n",
      "See where she comes from shrift with merry look.\n",
      "How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?\n",
      "Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin\n",
      "Of disobedient opposition\n",
      "To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd\n",
      "By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,\n",
      "And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!\n",
      "Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.\n",
      "Send for the county; go tell him of this:\n",
      "I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.\n",
      "I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;\n",
      "And gave him what becomed love I might,\n",
      "Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.\n",
      "Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:\n",
      "This is as't should be. Let me see the county;\n",
      "Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.\n",
      "Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,\n",
      "Our whole city is much bound to him.\n",
      "Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,\n",
      "To help me sort such needful ornaments\n",
      "As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?\n",
      "No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.\n",
      "Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.\n",
      "We shall be short in our provision:\n",
      "'Tis now near night.\n",
      "Tush, I will stir about,\n",
      "And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:\n",
      "Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;\n",
      "I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;\n",
      "I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!\n",
      "They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself\n",
      "To County Paris, to prepare him up\n",
      "Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,\n",
      "Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.\n",
      "Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,\n",
      "I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,\n",
      "For I have need of many orisons\n",
      "To move the heavens to smile upon my state,\n",
      "Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.\n",
      "What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?\n",
      "No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries\n",
      "As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:\n",
      "So please you, let me now be left alone,\n",
      "And let the nurse this night sit up with you;\n",
      "For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,\n",
      "In this so sudden business.\n",
      "Good night:\n",
      "Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.\n",
      "Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.\n",
      "I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,\n",
      "That almost freezes up the heat of life:\n",
      "I'll call them back again to comfort me:\n",
      "Nurse! What should she do here?\n",
      "My dismal scene I needs must act alone.\n",
      "Come, vial.\n",
      "What if this mixture do not work at all?\n",
      "Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?\n",
      "No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.\n",
      "What if it be a poison, which the friar\n",
      "Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,\n",
      "Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,\n",
      "Because he married me before to Romeo?\n",
      "I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,\n",
      "For he hath still been tried a holy man.\n",
      "How if, when I am laid into the tomb,\n",
      "I wake before the time that Romeo\n",
      "Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!\n",
      "Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,\n",
      "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\n",
      "And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\n",
      "Or, if I live, is it not very like,\n",
      "The horrible conceit of death and night,\n",
      "Together with the terror of the place,--\n",
      "As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,\n",
      "Where, for these many hundred years, the bones\n",
      "Of all my buried ancestors are packed:\n",
      "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\n",
      "Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,\n",
      "At some hours in the night spirits resort;--\n",
      "Alack, alack, is it not like that I,\n",
      "So early waking, what with loathsome smells,\n",
      "And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,\n",
      "That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--\n",
      "O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\n",
      "Environed with all these hideous fears?\n",
      "And madly play with my forefather's joints?\n",
      "And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?\n",
      "And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,\n",
      "As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?\n",
      "O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost\n",
      "Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body\n",
      "Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!\n",
      "Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.\n",
      "Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.\n",
      "They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.\n",
      "Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,\n",
      "The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:\n",
      "Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:\n",
      "Spare not for the cost.\n",
      "Go, you cot-quean, go,\n",
      "Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow\n",
      "For this night's watching.\n",
      "No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now\n",
      "All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.\n",
      "Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;\n",
      "But I will watch you from such watching now.\n",
      "A jealous hood, a jealous hood!\n",
      "Now, fellow,\n",
      "What's there?\n",
      "Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.\n",
      "Make haste, make haste.\n",
      "Sirrah, fetch drier logs:\n",
